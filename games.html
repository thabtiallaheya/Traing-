						<h4>English places</h4>
						<p> 
							This game offers to approach the places in English. There are 20 locations to find in all. Each time we can hear the sentence said in English to soak up the accent, in passing.
							On the game's home page, you can view the places, with their English designation.</p>

						<img src="img/games/actions.JPG" alt="">
						<h4>English actions</h4>
						<p> 
							
In line with the game that allows you to work on emotions in English, this one deals with actions!
We will find action verbs like walking, sleeping, eating, playing ... in small sentences.
 The goal is to find each time the right proposition according to the displayed image.</p>

						<img src="img/games/emotions.JPG" alt="">
						<h4>English emotions</h4>
						<p> 
							This game will allow you to work on emotions in English. The principle is simple: a character appears and you have to find the emotion that emerges from this character.</p>

						<img src="img/games/colors.JPG" alt="">
						<h4>English colors</h4>
						<p> This game will ask to find the name of a color. A list is presented and the user must choose the correct name from this list. It could have been interesting to also write the name of the color (a bit like the other English games) but a slightly different approach allows to vary the pleasures a little.</p>

						<h4>The vocabulary of clothes</h4>
						<p> 
							Here is the continuation of the adventures with this time a game on the vocabulary related to clothes.
							As usual, you have to choose your mode:
							
							English to French or
							French to English.</p>

						<img src="img/games/numbres.JPG" alt="">
						<h4> Numbres from one to twenty </h4>
						<p> Among the essential things to know in English: writing numbers. This game focuses on the first numbers: 1 to 20.
							As for French, this is where there are the most different words to learn, the rest is less complicated from a vocabulary / spelling point of view (from a mathematics point of view, it's something else)
							
							For this game, a new mode has appeared because it lends itself well to it:
							
							English to French;
							English to numbers in numbers or
							French to English.</p>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="service-item">
						<img src="img/games/family.JPG" alt="">
						<h4>family's vocabulary</h4>
						<p> 
							Here is a new set of words on the theme of the family. Some words are often used (father, mother, brother, sister ...), others are perhaps more anecdotal (niece or nephew for example) but overall this series should very quickly find its use.</p>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="service-item">
						<img src="img/games/food.JPG" alt="">
						<h4>food's vocabulary</h4>
						<p> 
							After the frequent verbs in English, here are the foods.
							There are twenty very common foods in order to have a stock of words in this area.
							How does it work?
							You have to choose your mode:
							
							English to French (with the possibility of hearing the word with the correct accent);
							French to English.</p>
						<a onclick="playAudio()" href="english_food.html" class="readmore">Start gaming <img src="img/arrow.png" alt=""></a>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="service-item">
						<img src="img/games/annimals.JPG" alt="">
						<h4>vocabulary about animals</h4>
						<p> This new vocabulary game in English will allow you to work on the names of animals.
							Some will be easy, like the dog (dog) or the cat (cat) but you may have more difficulty with the rabbit (rabbit), the wolf (wolf) or the sheep (sheep) ...
							20 animals are present in this game. It is therefore not exhaustive but it will give a good basis, a priori sufficient to respond to many situations!</p>
